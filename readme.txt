Extends the Users Insights plugin by adding an option to list and filter the users by the number of posts they have created from each custom post type

== Description ==
Extends the default user post activity functionality of the [Users Insights plugin](https://usersinsights.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_campaign=cpt).
Users Insights by default provides the total number of posts created by each user, including pages and any custom post types. Sometimes however, you might need to list, search and filter your user list by the number of posts that they have created from a specific post type only. This plugin allows you to do this by adding the following features:

* List the number of posts that each user has created from each custom post type
* [Filter the user list](https://usersinsights.com/wordpress-users-smart-filters/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_campaign=cpt) by the number of posts that they have created from each custom post type
* Sort the user list by the number of posts that they have created from each custom post type
* Select which post types to be available on the Users Insights table
